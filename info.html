Info

<p>
In this site is a list of all unknown songs in SM64 romhacks. The original source for these songs has been lost to time by either the port authors, or the author is unable to be contacted. As well, the song or its name must not be easily recognizable, or easily be found via simple means (sm64 hack wiki and google). Also, you might want to ensure the music is not an original composition.
<br> <br>
If you know the source of a song that is on this list, or you know another song that is unknown, contact DNVIC#2075 on discord and he will add it.
